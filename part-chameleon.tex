\part{Chameleon}

This section is entirely copied from the Chameleon Web page. We like
to mention that we do not want to plagiarize, but are asking chameleon
for permission to redistribute this. 

In any case please visit the CHameleon Web page as there is also more
information about other topics that we may not care about. Furthermore
we do not use Advanced Appliences, but use ansible instead as it is
independent from OpenStack and can be used with other frameworks.
